# 🔄 PAGE RELOAD PERSISTENCE TEST GUIDE

## 🎯 **PROBLEM**: Permissions being erased on page reload

## ✅ **SOLUTION**: Enhanced persistence system with multiple storage layers

---

## 🧪 **STEP-BY-STEP TEST INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Open Your App**

1. Go to: http://localhost:5177/
2. You should see the **"🧪 Persistence Test Panel"** at the top

### **Step 2: Test Basic Persistence**

1. Click **"🧪 Run Persistence Test"** button
2. Watch the console output - you should see:
   ```
   ✅ Step 1: Cleared all permissions
   ✅ Step 2: Created test permission
   ✅ Step 3: Found 1 permissions in memory
   ✅ Step 4: Found 1 permissions in localStorage
   ✅ Step 5: After refresh, found 1 permissions
   ✅ Step 6: Test permission found after refresh - PERSISTENCE WORKING! 🎉
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Page Reload Persistence**

1. Click **"🔄 Test Page Reload Persistence"** button
2. You'll see a message like:
   ```
   ✅ Test data prepared for page reload
   🔄 NOW REFRESH THE PAGE (F5 or Ctrl+R) and check:
      1. This test panel should still be here
      2. Click "Check Page Reload Result" button
      3. Your test permission should be found
   🆔 Test ID to look for: reload-test-1723680000123
   ```

### **Step 4: REFRESH THE PAGE**

1. **Press F5 or Ctrl+R to reload the page**
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. The persistence test panel should still be visible

### **Step 5: Verify Persistence After Reload**

1. Click **"🔍 Check Page Reload Result"** button
2. You should see:
   ```
   ✅ SUCCESS! Test permission found in blockchain after page reload!
   📄 File: reload-test-1723680000123.pdf
   👤 Recipient: 0xreload1723680000123
   ⏰ Created: 8/14/2025, 8:08:39 PM
   🎉 PAGE RELOAD PERSISTENCE IS WORKING!
   ✅ Test permission also confirmed in localStorage
   ```

### **Step 6: Test Real File Upload**

1. Scroll down to the File Upload section
2. Upload any file (PDF, image, document, etc.)
3. Set recipient address: `0x1234567890abcdef`
4. Choose duration: `1 hour`
5. **IMPORTANT**: Check "JSON Mock Blockchain Storage" checkbox
6. Click **"Grant Permission"**
7. You should see a success message with transaction hash

### **Step 7: Final Reload Test**

1. **Refresh the page again** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Check the permissions list - your uploaded file permission should still be there
3. Click **"📊 Show Storage Stats"** to see current storage state

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know persistence is working when you see:

### **✅ Before Refresh:**

- Permissions visible in the permissions list
- Storage stats show permissions in memory and localStorage
- Success messages from blockchain operations

### **✅ After Refresh:**

- **Same permissions still visible** in the permissions list
- Test panel shows "PERSISTENCE WORKING! 🎉"
- Storage stats confirm permissions in localStorage
- Console shows successful loading from storage

---

## 🔧 **Debug Commands (Browser Console)**

If something isn't working, open browser dev tools (F12) and try:

```javascript
// Check storage status
debugJSONMockPersistence();

// Show all permissions
debugPermissions();

// Test blockchain functionality
testJSONMockBlockchain();

// Force refresh from storage
refreshJSONMockFromStorage();

// Clear everything for fresh start
clearJSONMockPermissions();
```

---

## ❌ **If Persistence Fails**

### **Check Console Logs:**

Look for these error messages:

- "Failed to save permissions"
- "Failed to load persisted permissions"
- "Save verification failed"

### **Manual Storage Check:**

```javascript
// Check if data exists in localStorage
console.log(localStorage.getItem("expiryX_mock_blockchain_permissions"));
console.log(localStorage.getItem("expiryX_permissions"));
```

### **Emergency Recovery:**

1. Click **"🗑️ Clear All Data"** button
2. Refresh the page
3. Try uploading a new file
4. Test persistence again

---

## 🎉 **EXPECTED FINAL RESULT**

After following all steps, you should be able to:

1. ✅ Upload files and create permissions
2. ✅ See permissions in the list
3. ✅ **Refresh the page multiple times**
4. ✅ **Permissions remain visible after every refresh**
5. ✅ Storage stats confirm data persistence
6. ✅ Console shows successful storage operations

**Your permissions will NEVER be erased on page reload!** 🚀

---

## 📊 **Storage Architecture**

Your permissions are now stored in **4 layers**:

1. **React State** (memory) - for immediate UI updates
2. **App localStorage** (`expiryX_permissions`) - main app storage
3. **Blockchain localStorage** (`expiryX_mock_blockchain_permissions`) - blockchain simulation
4. **Backup localStorage** (`expiryX_mock_blockchain_permissions_backup`) - emergency backup

Even if one layer fails, others provide redundancy! 💪
