# ExpiryX Setup & Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview

ExpiryX is a token permission expiry DApp built on Aptos that allows users to grant time-limited spending permissions with automatic expiry functionality.

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. Smart Contract (`contract/sources/message_board.move`)

- **Module**: `message_board_addr::expiry_x`
- **Functions**:
  - `grant_permission()`: Create spending permissions
  - `revoke_permission()`: Cancel permissions early
  - `spend_tokens()`: Use granted permissions (tracks usage)
  - View functions for querying permissions
- **Events**: Comprehensive event emission for all actions
- **Tests**: Full test coverage with passing unit tests

### 2. Frontend Application

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Chakra UI** for dark theme components
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **Aptos Wallet Adapter** for multi-wallet support

#### Key Components:

- `LandingPage`: Animated introduction with feature showcase
- `Dashboard`: Main permission management interface
- `PermissionCard`: Individual permission with countdown timers
- `GrantPermissionForm`: Form for creating new permissions
- `Header`: Navigation with theme toggle

### 3. Features Implemented

- ✅ Time-limited permissions with expiry
- ✅ Spending limits and usage tracking
- ✅ Permission revocation
- ✅ Real-time countdown timers
- ✅ Dark/light theme toggle
- ✅ Responsive mobile-friendly design
- ✅ Animated UI components
- ✅ Event emission and tracking
- ✅ Multi-wallet support

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Compile the contract**

   ```bash
   npm run move:compile
   ```

2. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   npm run move:test
   ```

3. **Deploy to Aptos Devnet**

   ```bash
   npm run move:publish
   ```

4. **Update contract address** in `frontend/utils/expiryXHelpers.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const EXPIRY_X_ADDRESS = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS_HERE";
   ```

### Frontend Deployment

1. **Local development**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Production build**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
REACT_APP_NETWORK=devnet
REACT_APP_EXPIRY_X_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
```

### Wallet Setup

1. Install Petra Wallet or Martian Wallet
2. Switch to Aptos Devnet
3. Fund your account using the devnet faucet

## 🎮 How to Use ExpiryX

### For Permission Granters (Owners):

1. Connect your Aptos wallet
2. Click "Grant Permission" tab
3. Enter:
   - Spender's wallet address
   - Maximum spending amount (APT)
   - Expiry date/time
4. Confirm transaction
5. Monitor usage in the dashboard

### For Permission Recipients (Spenders):

1. Connect your wallet
2. View received permissions in dashboard
3. Enter amount to spend (≤ remaining allowance)
4. Confirm spend transaction
5. Track remaining allowances

### Permission Management:

- **Active Permissions**: Green status, countdown timer
- **Expired Permissions**: Red status, automatic deactivation
- **Revoked Permissions**: Gray status, manually cancelled
- **Fully Spent**: Orange status, allowance exhausted

## 🏗 Architecture Details

### Smart Contract Structure:

```
Permission {
  owner: address,
  spender: address,
  amount: u64,
  spent: u64,
  expiry_timestamp: u64,
  is_active: bool
}
```

### Frontend Structure:

```

├── components/
│   ├── LandingPage.tsx
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── PermissionCard.tsx
│   ├── GrantPermissionForm.tsx
│   └── Header.tsx
├── utils/

│   ├── expiryXHelpers.ts
│   └── aptosClient.ts
└── view-functions/
    └── getExpiryXData.ts
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Animations:

- Smooth card transitions with Framer Motion
- Real-time countdown timers
- Color-coded status indicators
- Hover effects and micro-interactions
- Loading states and transitions

### Theme:

- Dark mode by default
- Customizable color scheme
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility features
- Clean, modern interface

## 🧪 Testing

### Smart Contract Tests:

- ✅ Grant permission functionality
- ✅ Spend tokens tracking
- ✅ Permission revocation
- ✅ Expiry validation
- ✅ Access control checks

### Frontend Testing:

- Mock data integration for development
- Real-time UI updates
- Error handling and validation
- Responsive design testing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:

- [ ] Real token transfers (requires owner signature mechanism)
- [ ] Multi-token support beyond APT
- [ ] Recurring permissions
- [ ] Permission templates
- [ ] Email/push notifications
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Mobile app version

### Technical Improvements:

- [ ] Event indexing for transaction history
- [ ] Backend API for enhanced features
- [ ] PostgreSQL integration for user preferences
- [ ] Advanced permission patterns
- [ ] Batch operations

## 🛡 Security Considerations

### Current Security Features:

- ✅ Access control (only owners can revoke)
- ✅ Time-based expiry enforcement
- ✅ Spending limit validation
- ✅ Event auditing
- ✅ Input validation

### Security Notes:

- Contract focuses on permission tracking
- Actual token transfers require additional security mechanisms
- Production deployment needs thorough security audit
- Consider implementing token escrow for enhanced security
