# 🚀 ExpiryX Blockchain Deployment Status

## ✅ What's Ready

✅ **Move Smart Contract** (`contract/sources/message_board.move`)

- Complete with file storage, permissions, and event emission
- Handles grant_permission_with_file, get_permissions_by_owner
- Ready for deployment to Aptos blockchain

✅ **Deployment Scripts**

- `deploy-to-blockchain.bat` - Complete Windows deployment
- `scripts/deploy-direct.js` - Node.js deployment script
- `scripts/install-and-setup.js` - Automatic CLI installer

✅ **Frontend Integration**

- `frontend/services/unifiedBlockchainService.ts` - Auto-detects real vs mock blockchain
- `frontend/constants.ts` - Configured for real blockchain mode
- Will automatically switch to permanent storage after deployment

✅ **NPM Scripts**

```bash
npm run setup:aptos          # Install and setup Aptos CLI
npm run deploy:blockchain    # Deploy contract to blockchain
npm run blockchain:setup     # Complete setup and deployment
```

## 🎯 Next Step: Deploy to Real Blockchain

**Option 1 - Automatic (Recommended):**

```bash
# Double-click in Windows Explorer:
deploy-to-blockchain.bat
```

**Option 2 - Manual Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Install Aptos CLI (choose one):
winget install Aptos.CLI
# OR download from: https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases

# 2. Initialize account
aptos init --network devnet

# 3. Fund account
aptos account fund-with-faucet --account default

# 4. Deploy contract
cd contract
aptos move publish --named-addresses message_board_addr=default

# 5. Start app
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Current State

- **Backend**: Ready for blockchain deployment
- **Frontend**: Configured to auto-detect real blockchain
- **Storage**: Will switch from localStorage to permanent blockchain storage
- **Waiting**: Aptos CLI installation and contract deployment

## 🎉 After Deployment

When deployment succeeds:

1. ✅ Contract will be live on Aptos Devnet
2. ✅ Frontend will automatically detect and use real blockchain
3. ✅ File permissions stored permanently on blockchain
4. ✅ No more localStorage dependency
5. ✅ Works across all devices and browsers

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Steps

If automatic deployment doesn't work:

1. **Install Aptos CLI:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases
   - Download Windows version
   - Extract and add to PATH

2. **Setup Account:**

   ```bash
   aptos init --network devnet
   ```

3. **Deploy Contract:**

   ```bash
   cd contract
   aptos move compile
   aptos move publish --named-addresses message_board_addr=default
   ```

4. **Update Frontend:**
   - Copy the deployed contract address
   - Update `REAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `frontend/constants.ts`

5. **Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Upload files -> stored on blockchain!
   ```

---

🎯 **Goal**: Replace localStorage with permanent Aptos blockchain storage
🚀 **Status**: Ready to deploy - just need Aptos CLI installation
